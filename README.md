`PL (Property-Listing)` is an online web application that serves as a single platform for property buyers and sellers in India to discover properties of interest.

#### For the service that runs the backend of the application check out [Property-Listing-Backend](https://github.com/parithoshpoojary/property-listing-api).

## Getting Started

- **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/parithoshpoojary/property-listing.git`
- **Change your dir to:** `cd property-listing/`

###### This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To install all of its dependencies and start the application, follow the instructions below.

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) installed globally. I used `npm` package manager to manage all the dependencies. To install npm [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

**Change your dir to:** `cd property-listing/master/frontend`

After installing the npm, run `npm install` on the commnad prompt to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute or so).
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the Project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#### For more information on building and running the application, visit [Angular - Serve](https://angular.io/cli/serve), [Angular - Build](https://angular.io/cli/build).
